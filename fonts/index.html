        Kathak (Devanagari: कथक) is one of the nine major forms of Indian
        classical dance. Its origin is attributed to the traveling bards in
        ancient northern India known as Kathakar ("storyteller"), who
        communicated stories from the Hindu epics through dance, songs and
        music. Its name derives from the Sanskrit word katha which means
        "story", and kathakar which means "the one who tells a story" or "to do
        with stories".
